6,,,,,The room was unbearably hot with no way to adjust temperature as the windows were locked and could not be opened - horrendous,,,,,
6,,,,,The beds were uncomfortable,,,,,
6,,,,,There was no extractor room in the bathroom so the whole room resembled a sauna after the shower was used,,,,,
6,,,,,It was very warm in our room so we had to open the window and put up with the noise,,,,,

6,,,,,Only issue for us was that the hot water ran out after one shower,,,,,
6,,,,,The hot water ran out pretty quickly but I would still book this place again in a heartbeat,,,,,
6,,,,,"The bed was too small for me, which is common in Europe (I’m 6’)",,,,,
6,,,,,"AC could be a little bit bigger(and quieter), but that's just because we're from the north and we are used to have it really really cold and quiet",,,,,
6,,,,,The air conditioning wasn't working properly,,,,,
6,,,,,"Some more of the basics like milk, clothes and dishwasher detergent.",,,,,
6,,,,,Another mirror in the apartment outside the bathroom would have been great and the towels could have been bigger,,,,,

11,,,,,From start to finish the whole time spent here was just fantastic,,,,,
11,,,,,The historic demesne has been converted into a state of the art Five-Star modern Hotel,,,,,
11,,,,," It is ideal for hosting a significant family occasion, such as your never to be forgotten wedding reception",,,,,

12,,,,,public areas looking tired,,,,,
12,,,,,The place is a bit of a warren and is very old-fashioned,,,,,
12,,,,,Architecturally it's pretty awful,,,,,
12,,,,,Good value for money,,,,,
12,,,,,The outside building looks out of place and ugly,,,,,

12,,,,,The hotel is located on the 5th floor of a pretty old block of flats.,,,,,
12,,,,,The property is insanely diffuclt to find especially if you are still out of it from your flight in.,,,,,
12,,,,,I didn't like the place at all and was only coming to sleep for the night,,,,,
12,,,,, It is definitely not worth the cheap price,,,,,
12,,,,,Wifi was intermittent,,,,,
12,,,,,"The hotel is extremely old, it really needs some urgent renovation",,,,,

12,,,,,It was difficult to find a hotel right away,,,,,
12,,,,,In the hotel there is no place where you could sit \ take a bite \ use a laptop,,,,,
12,,,,,in hostel reception you can pay only in cash,,,,,
12,,,,,The immediate area around the hostel has drunks/men who will yell things at you and make you feel uncomfortable,,,,,
12,,,,,"It is a very small and old venue, on the fifth floor of a building not in the best part of the city",,,,,
12,,,,,This place is terrible to stay.,,,,,
12,,,,, It is actually a very small hostel with just three 4-6ppl-mixed-rooms sharing one toilet and bathroom,,,,,

12,,,,,"In a nutshell, even though this hostel is quite cheap, you should be able to find one with better services and quality within this price range",,,,,
12,,,,,The room was not as the photos that they show,,,,,
12,,,,, It was the worst experience on my whole journey,,,,,
12,,,,, I think it was the worst hostel I ever stayed in,,,,,
12,,,,,"I thought I will have serious health problems after my stay,",,,,,
12,,,,,The cost was more than the cost that was prearranged from Booking,,,,,
12,,,,,There is extra cost for using the Gym and pool which is unacceptable for a 5 star hotel,,,,,
12,,,,,"We were given a twin beds room, instead of a double bed room",,,,,
12,,,,,"Arrived hotel, closed door, so darkness and terrible",,,,,
12,,,,,"Althout we paid for 2 nights, we stayed only 1 night",,,,,
12,,,,,"Because beds make really so much voices, that’s why we couldn’t even a little bit sleep",,,,,
12,,,,,Worst experience I've ever had,,,,,
12,,,,,"This was a horrendous experience and what's more, they charged me for the room in full price, despite no hot water and no heating which is shocking",,,,,
